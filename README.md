# TriviaGame
Trivia Game Repository

This exercise was to work with timing.  The project was to create a trivia game that asks the user questions giving them a certain amount of time to answer before moving on to the next question.  Depending upon the result, the game would then display a correct/incorrect message for a certain amount of time before presenting the next question.  The game will record how many questions were answered correctly, incorrectly, and timed out.

Extra functionality that was added to this project:

* Randomize the questions so they don't appear in the same order every time.
* Randomize the answers to the question so that they don't appear in the same order every time.
